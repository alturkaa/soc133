1) Download prerequisites

- Download R from this site: https://cran.r-project.org/. Once you install it, you don't have to open it. 
- Download RStudio (the "development environment" that runs R) from this site: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. Click on the (free) version under "Installers for Supported Platforms" that corresponds to your operating system. Install it. In class, we'll do everything in RStudio.

2) Complete two intro lessons in something called "swirl"

There is an interactive way to learn R called "swirl." Instructions for how to get started with swirl can be found here: http://swirlstats.com/students.html. Or you can follow my instructions:

- After you've installed R and RStudio, open RStudio and under Console, type install.packages("swirl").
- While you're at it, type install.packages("tidyverse"). This may take a little while. We'll use tidyverse a lot in class.
- Then, type library("swirl")
- Then, type swirl()
- Once you enter your name and it asks you to pick a course, choose "R Programming" by typing the number that course corresponds to.
- Then, choose the lesson "Basic Building Blocks"
- Go through that lesson.
- When you're done with that lesson, go back to the "R Programming" course and choose the "Looking at Data" lesson, and go through that lesson.
